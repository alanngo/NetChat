For this assignment, we used both Java and Python as the two programming languages to
 implement the NetChat program. Java and Python have many similarities, in the sense 
that they both can support object-oriented programming and the fact they have prebuilt
 socket objects. Both languages are object-oriented language with extensive standard 
libraries. Aside from the language structure, the way both languages handle connections
 and the input format, both programs have the same logical structure and pretty much do
the same thing. As far as which one was our favorite, we picked Java, since we all knew
 that language better and we were more familiar with its semantics and syntax. Compared 
to Python, Java needs more specifications like type declaration, which is nice because
 we know what types we are working with and we know the APIS we need. Additionally, Java 
isn’t indent sensitive, which made debugging the program a lot easier and more efficient, 
whereas in Python, a majority of our errors were due to indentation problems, which was 
kind of annoying. All in all, our preferred method was to implement our program in Java 
over Python because it is easier to debug and more clear about what variable types in 
addition to the fact that Java isn’t indent-sensitive.

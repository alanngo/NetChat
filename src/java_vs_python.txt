We are using Java and Python as the two programming languages to implement our NetChat program. Java and Python have many similarities. Both languages are object-oriented language with extensive standard libraries. And both languages have strong cross-platform support.
Compare to Python, Java needs more specifications like type declaration. So that Java code generally is longer than Python code. Also, Python is indent sensitive however Java is not.
I prefer Java over Python because it is easier to debug since we don't need to worry about messing up the variable type or inconsistent indentation.
